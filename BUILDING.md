# Building Android Auto Wireless

This repository contains a docker setup to make the build process easy.

If you choose to build without Docker, refer [the Buildroot user manual
](https://buildroot.org/downloads/manual/manual.html) for more details on dependencies and setup.

## Clone
```shell
$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/nisargjhaveri/WirelessAndroidAutoDongle
```

## Build with Docker
```shell
$ docker compose run --rm rpi4 # See docker-compose.yml for available options.
```

You can use `rpi0w`, `rpi02w`, `rpi3a` or `rpi4` to build and generate an sdcard image. Once the build is successful, it'll copy the generated sdcard image in `images/` directory.

You can also use the `bash` service for more control over the build process and experimentation.

```shell
$ docker compose run --rm bash
```

## Build with manual setup
Once you have a recursive clone, you can manually build using the following set of commands.

```shell
$ cd buildroot
$ make BR2_EXTERNAL=../aa_wireless/ O=output/rpi0w raspberrypi0w_defconfig # Change output and defconfig for your board
$ cd output/rpi0w
$ make
```

When successful, this should generate the sd card image at `images/sdcard.img` in your output directory. See the "Install and Run" instructions above to use this image.

Use one of the following defconfig for the board you intend to use:
- `raspberrypi0w_defconfig` - Raspberry Pi Zero W
- `raspberrypizero2w_defconfig` - Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W
- `raspberrypi3a_defconfig` - Raspberry Pi 3A+
- `raspberrypi4_defconfig` - Raspberry Pi 4
